# Database Connector

This is a Java program that connects to a MySQL database and allows the user to view, add, update, and delete rows using a graphical user interface (GUI).

## Dependencies

- Java
- MySQL Connector/J library (version 8.0.23)

## Usage

To use this program, follow these steps:

1. Open the `database_connector.java` file in an IDE or text editor.
2. Replace the default values for the server, port, database, username, password, and table variables with your own values.
3. Save the file and compile it using a Java compiler.
4. Run the compiled program from the command line or using an IDE.

When the program starts, it will display a login screen where you can enter your database connection details. After you connect to the database, you will see a main screen with options to select a database and table, view, add, update, or delete rows, and disconnect from the database.
